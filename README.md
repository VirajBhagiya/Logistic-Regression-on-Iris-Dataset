# Regression-Algorithms

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python code implementing various machine learning models for different tasks. Each notebook focuses on a specific machine learning algorithm, providing both code and explanations to help you understand and apply these algorithms effectively.

## Table of Contents

- [Linear Regression](Linear-Regression.ipynb): Introduction to linear regression and how to use it for regression tasks.
- [Logistic Regression](Logistic-Regression.ipynb): Introduction to logistic regression and its application to binary classification problems.
- [Decision Trees](Decision-Trees.ipynb): Explanation and usage of decision trees for classification and regression tasks.
- [Random Forest](Random-Forest.ipynb): An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees for improved predictive performance.
- [XGBoost](XGBoost.ipynb): Extreme Gradient Boosting, a powerful boosting algorithm for classification and regression.
- [Support Vector Machines (SVM)](SVM.ipynb): Introduction to SVMs and their use in both classification and regression.

## Datasets

This repository uses two datasets for demonstrating the machine learning models:

- **Housing Dataset**: The "Housing" dataset is a popular dataset often used for regression tasks. It contains information about various housing features (e.g., number of bedrooms, area) and the corresponding median house values. The dataset is commonly used to train regression models for predicting house prices.

- **Iris Dataset**: The "Iris" dataset is a classic dataset used for classification tasks. It contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The task is to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on these measurements. It's a great dataset for practicing classification algorithms.
