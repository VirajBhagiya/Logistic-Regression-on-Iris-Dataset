# Regression-Algorithms 📊🔍

Welcome to the Regression-Algorithms repository! Here you'll find Jupyter notebooks and Python code that explore various machine learning models for different tasks. Each notebook dives deep into a specific machine learning algorithm, providing both code and explanations to help you understand and apply these algorithms effectively.

## Table of Contents 📚

- [Linear Regression](Linear-Regression.ipynb): 📈 Introduction to linear regression and how to use it for regression tasks.
- [Logistic Regression](Logistic-Regression.ipynb): 📊 Introduction to logistic regression and its application to binary classification problems.
- [Decision Trees](Decision-Trees.ipynb): 🌳 Explanation and usage of decision trees for classification and regression tasks.
- [Random Forest](Random-Forest.ipynb): 🌲 An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees for improved predictive performance.
- [XGBoost](XGBoost.ipynb): 🚀 Extreme Gradient Boosting, a powerful boosting algorithm for classification and regression.

## Datasets 📂📊

This repository utilizes two fascinating datasets to illustrate the power of these machine learning models:

- **Housing Dataset**: 🏡 The "Housing" dataset is a popular choice for regression tasks. It contains valuable information about various housing features (e.g., number of bedrooms, area) and the corresponding median house values. You can use this dataset to train regression models for predicting house prices.

- **Iris Dataset**: 🌺 The "Iris" dataset is a classic dataset designed for classification tasks. It offers detailed measurements of iris flowers from three distinct species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Your challenge is to classify iris flowers into their respective species using these measurements. It's a perfect dataset for practicing classification algorithms.
